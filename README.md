UnityClickerTest

Friday april 1 14:50 : my files disapears and I lost about 3 hours of work. Also my git client seems broken and does not take my modifications.

Since my git client is broken, I was not able to commit regularly. You can find my last commit here.
Also, my .gitignore was clearly not set-up and the git client add avery files to my repersitory (on my first commit).

I did everything that concern exercice a and b except the menu rescalling (a.6). Most parts of the code is commented.
I add animation on the menu and the tent so now the game feels more smooth.
I also create a small design based on the in-game colors.  

I detailed why I didn't do the exercice c in comment of my code.
